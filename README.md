wp-locksite
===========

A WordPress plugin for lock down sites until they are ready for public access. You add allowed IP addresses in the configuration and IP addresses that are not allowed will get a "This site is locked" message. wp-admin is not locked, so you can always remove the lock if you log in as admin.

* This plugin is not ready for production use yet! *
